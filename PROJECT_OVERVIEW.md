# Frequency Tuning Portal

## Vision

An interactive self-recognition tool that helps conscious entrepreneurs and high-performers understand their current energetic state across the fundamental frequencies of creation — guiding them from where they are to where they want to be through alignment rather than force.

## Core Philosophy

### The Triangulation of Movement

1. **Where I Am** — Self-Recognition (current frequency/tuning)
2. **The Map** — The Triads + Domains (understanding the territory)
3. **Where I'm Going** — Vision + Desires (the destination)

Movement becomes natural when all three are clear. Energy before effort means aligning current frequency with desired frequency *before* pushing into action.

### Energy Before Effort

- Ask and it's given (immediately as energy) — 90% shows up energetically, the last 10% is alignment
- Align energy before taking action
- Energy & Magnetism (what we attract) vs Effort & Manipulation (what we force)
- When energy is first, effort feels effortless
- The result of alignment is flow, ease, and energy moving through the path of least resistance

### The Tuning Metaphor

This is not a test or assessment. It's tuning — like an instrument. A guitar isn't "bad" when it's out of tune; it just needs attention. No grades (0-100), just calibration. The questions reveal current resonance, not worth.

## The Framework

### The Feminine Triad (Receiving, Magnetism, Being)
Colors: Pink, Purple, Violet

| Note | Essence |
|------|---------|
| **Safety** | The ground from which expansion happens. Not playing small — the foundation for sustainable growth. |
| **Pleasure** | The guidance system. Tells you where life is flowing. |
| **Power** | Capacity to create and choose. Not force — creative authority. |

### The Masculine Triad (Expression, Movement, Doing)
Colors: Blue, Green, Turquoise

| Note | Essence |
|------|---------|
| **Light** | Illumination, clarity. Seeing what's actually here. |
| **Now** | Presence. The only place creation happens. |
| **Heat** | Creative tension. Life force. Too much burns, too little stagnates. |

### The Creative Tension Spectrum

```
Too Tight (Stress) ←——→ Resonance ←——→ Too Loose (Stagnation)
Gripping, forcing      Flow, aliveness      Collapsed, avoidant
```

Both extremes are resistance. True creative power lives in engaged relaxation.

### The Seven Life Domains

Where the frequencies play out:

1. **Spirit** — God, Universe, Energy, Source, the Quantum
2. **Body** — Health, feelings, sensations, lived experience
3. **Self** — Mind, identity, self-awareness, inner narrative
4. **Relationships** — Others, love, intimacy, self-love reflected
5. **Wealth** — Money, prosperity, abundance, provision
6. **Purpose** — Impact, contribution, legacy, meaning
7. **Play** — Fun, adventure, lightness, joy

## The Journey

**Self-Recognition → Self-Compassion → Self-Love → Acceptance → Alignment**

The questions create moments of seeing. Each honest answer is self-recognition. The visual feedback reflects without judgment, inviting compassion. The guidance offers love back into tune — not fix, not improve, just attune.

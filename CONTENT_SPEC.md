## GUIDANCE LIBRARY

### Safety Practices

**For Tight Safety:**
- Legs up the wall for 5 minutes — let gravity hold you
- Ask yourself: "What would I do right now if I knew I was completely safe?"

**For Loose Safety:**
- Place your hands on your body and say "I'm here"
- Name five things you can see, four you can hear, three you can touch

### Power Practices

**For Tight Power:**
